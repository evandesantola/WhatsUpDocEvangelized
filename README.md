This code is a very old version.  Right now, our free access to our Azure servers has been removed and a lot of the updated code is trapped in limbo.  An updated version with our full functionality will be posted as soon as we get this sorted out.

This code (which has already been written but is trapped in limbo) includes the following features:
     * More robust diagnoses, including a system where user gives voice feedback in order to pinpoint the correct diagnoses
     * More Machine Learning fun
     * A text-seach feature so users can send texts to get information
     * Nicer overall product
     * Lots of documentation, including who did what

The following is coming soon (almost as soon as code is recovered):
     * Language recognition and translation tools
     * Even more ML Fun
# WhatsUpDocEvangelized
WhatsUpDoc has been made into one easy to understand python file.  The rails framework has been dropped and I have used flask so twilio will run on it
